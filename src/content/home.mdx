## Core Expertise

### Strategic Product & Technology Leadership

I excel at creating cohesive product-technology strategies that drive business growth. My background as both a product leader and technologist allows me to bridge these worlds effectively, eliminating the silos that slow companies down. I unify vision and execution across both disciplines to create sustainable competitive advantage.

### Autonomous Team Design & Effectiveness

I pioneer approaches for creating truly autonomous, high-performing teams that maintain velocity without micromanagement. My leadership philosophy focuses on clarity, context, and trust—creating the conditions for teams to thrive independently while delivering consistent results. Real autonomy isn't about chaos—it's about clarity that enables order to emerge naturally.

### Executive Technology Leadership

I provide executive-level product and technology leadership during critical periods of growth and transition. My experience spans startups to Fortune 50s, giving me unique insight into scaling challenges and practical solutions that drive measurable business outcomes through technology excellence.
