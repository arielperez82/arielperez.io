# Step-by-Step Plan to Build arielperez.io as a Walking Skeleton

Here's a progressive approach to building your website, starting with the absolute minimum viable product and gradually expanding from there. This plan prioritizes pages by impact and builds the site in a way that provides value even in the earliest stages.

## Phase 1: Single-Page MVP (Task 1)

**Build a comprehensive Home page that functions as a complete mini-site:**

1. **Header:**
   - Your name and tagline ("Product & Technology Leader")
   - Simple navigation menu (links will initially just be anchors to sections on the same page)

2. **Hero Section:**
   - Professional headshot
   - Compelling headline that captures your value proposition
   - Brief (2-3 sentence) overview of who you are and your primary expertise
   - Primary CTA: "Contact for Services" (linking to temporary mailto or form)

3. **Core Expertise Section:**
   - Brief overview of your three key expertise areas
   - Simple cards or sections for each area:
     - Strategic Product & Technology Leadership
     - Autonomous Team Design & Effectiveness

   - Each with a 2-3 sentence description

4. **Mini About Section:**
   - Condensed professional bio (150-200 words)
   - Link to your LinkedIn profile
   - Link to download your resume

## Priority Order Summary

If you need to simplify even further, here's the absolute priority order for pages:

1. Home (as a comprehensive mini-site)
2. About
3. Expertise
4. Services
5. Blog overview
6. Contact (comprehensive)
7. Speaking
