# SimpleQueue: Product Requirements Document

## 1\. Elevator Pitch

SimpleQueue is a minimalist, high-performance messaging queue service built for modern development teams. It provides the essential capabilities developers need to reliably process asynchronous workloads without the complexity of enterprise solutions or the operational burden of self-hosted systems. With a focus on simplicity, observability, and developer experience, SimpleQueue helps small teams build resilient applications with less code and zero infrastructure management.

## 2\. Who is this app for

SimpleQueue is designed for:

-   **Small Engineering Teams**: Who need reliable message processing without dedicated infrastructure engineers
-   **Full-Stack Developers**: Building applications that need background processing capabilities
-   **Startups**: With limited resources who can't afford complex enterprise messaging solutions
-   **Solo Developers**: Who need queue functionality without operational overhead
-   **Teams Building Distributed Systems**: Who need simple, reliable communication between services

Specific personas include:

-   **Maria, Tech Lead at a 5-person startup**: Needs to implement background processing for user uploads without spinning up additional infrastructure
-   **Alex, Full-Stack Developer**: Building a SaaS app alone and needs to offload time-consuming tasks from web requests
-   **Taylor, Backend Engineer**: Needs to distribute work across multiple processing services but doesn't want to manage RabbitMQ

## 3\. Functional Requirements

### Queue Management

-   Create queues with minimal configuration
-   Delete queues
-   Pause queues (continue accepting new messages but temporarily suspend message consumption)
-   Resume paused queues
-   View basic queue statistics (depth, throughput)
-   Configure message retention period

### Message Publishing

-   Single message publish endpoint via REST API
-   Batch message publishing for efficiency
-   Support for JSON payloads with automatic schema detection
-   Optional message deduplication via client-supplied IDs

### Message Consumption

-   Pull-based consumption model via REST API
-   Configurable batch size (retrieve N messages at once)
-   Simple acknowledgment to remove messages from queue
-   Optional message rejection to return a message to the queue

### Reliability Model

-   At-least-once delivery guarantee
-   Messages remain in queue until explicitly acknowledged
-   No automatic redelivery or processing attempt tracking

### Observable Message Flow

-   Real-time queue depth monitoring
-   Message throughput metrics (enqueue/dequeue rate)
-   Age of oldest unprocessed message

### Security

-   API key-based authentication
-   Queue-level access control (publish/consume permissions)
-   Complete queue isolation between accounts

### Developer Experience

-   Comprehensive REST API documentation
-   Postman/Insomnia collection
-   Copy-paste cURL examples for basic operations

### Non-Functional Requirements

-   API rate limits:
    -   Maximum 10 requests per second per client
    -   Maximum data throughput of 2 MB/s per client
-   Message retrieval API response time under 100ms (time from consumer request to message delivery)
-   99.9% service availability
-   Messages securely stored for configured retention period
-   Horizontal scalability for high-volume queues

## 4\. User Stories

### As a queue administrator:

-   I can create a new queue by specifying just a name and retention period
-   I can delete a queue when it's no longer needed
-   I can pause a queue to temporarily stop message consumption while still accepting new messages
-   I can resume a paused queue to restart message consumption
-   I can view real-time metrics about queue depth and throughput
-   I can create and manage API keys with specific permissions

### As a message producer:

-   I can publish a single JSON message to a queue via REST API
-   I can publish multiple messages in a single API call for efficiency
-   I can specify a client-generated ID to prevent duplicate messages
-   I can verify a message was successfully enqueued

### As a message consumer:

-   I can fetch a batch of messages from a queue via REST API
-   I can acknowledge messages that have been successfully processed
-   I can reject messages that couldn't be processed
-   I can specify how many messages to retrieve in a single request
-   I can monitor the rate at which messages are being processed

### As a developer:

-   I can quickly understand how to integrate with SimpleQueue through documentation
-   I can use provided code examples to accelerate implementation
-   I can test the API through a Postman collection before writing code
-   I can monitor queue performance through a simple dashboard

## 5\. User Interface

The user interface will consist of:

### Web Dashboard

-   Simple queue creation form
-   List of all queues with key metrics
-   Queue detail view showing:
    -   Current depth
    -   Throughput graph
    -   Age of oldest message
    -   Basic configuration details
-   API key management interface
-   Documentation and getting started guide

### REST API

-   Clean, consistent REST API for all operations
-   Standard JSON request/response format
-   Clear error messages and status codes
-   Rate limiting headers
-   Authentication via API key header

### Future Interface Considerations

-   Command-line interface
-   JavaScript SDK (based on user demand)
-   Webhook configuration interface
-   Advanced metrics and monitoring dashboards
